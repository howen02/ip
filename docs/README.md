## Listing Tasks

Have a look at your existing tasks by listing them out with `list`

## Mark & Unmark

Mark and unmark your tasks whenever done with the `mark` and `unmark` commands

## Deleting Tasks

Are your old tasks taking up too much space?

Just delete them by specifying their index

Example: `snooze 2`
